 <h2>Chefs in a kitchen</h2>
  <h4>11/23/14</h4>
<p>
Right now from what I know I would sum up the DBC experience in one word, learning. The video made me even more excited for Dev Bootcamp, it cleared up how Dev bootcamp views itself. I thought that maybe DBC would kind of try to act like they were more founded then they were and not want to admit flaws and mistakes, But after the video I know that is not the case. It seems the staff are just as excited and hungry to learn as the students are. When the staff of a program lowers their guard and really tries to be honest and straightforward it will carry down to the students.

I am excited to be in the “Kitchen” type of environment where everyone is working as hard as they can, at different skill levels, but still all working together. Of course a little bit of nervousness/fear comes along with getting into something with no absolute outcome. I think that is why are culture is so leans toward the restaurant environment. With the restaurant environment there is a very clear connection between investment and outcome. But the fear is good I think, it pushes you to work hard because you are creating your own outcome.
