 <h2>Fitting in to the stryeotypes</h2>
  <h4>1/11/2015</h4>
<p>
There is an idea that was first brought to the spot-light by Dr. Claude Steele that we force are selves to morph into the stereotypes we are given. Most notably in his research was this acting out in black youth. Often it does not affect initial success but it does affect how we view our failures. Those that are in a minority stereotype of not being able to do something when they fail in that area they will blame in on genetic inability rather then lack of knowledge or practice. Where as a group who is viewed to be more successful in one area will become successful in that area because of a reverse effect. This research is very interesting and I definitely think that it is true, both for micro and macro-stereotypes. Even what family you come from feeds into how you view your ability to succeed in a variety of topics just based upon what you believe you can do. Now it might be a jump to say this but I also believe this to be in line with the idea of fake it till you make it. This is just not a saying, it has been proved that things you pretend to like or dislike actually feed into what you like and don't like. The same goes for your general mood, if you fake a smile you are more likely to be happy. There is no doubt that this is a danger for us going into Dev Bootcamp. Many of us have no previous experience in programing and do not fit into he stereotype of a programmer even I a white male which is usually the most prominent ethnicity as tech firms am incredibly fearful and unsure going into an experience like this. I need to continually remind myself that everyone who is a successful programmer today struggled to grasp some simple concepts at some point (well most anyway). The point being, we need to become more sure of ourselves and what we can do, we live in a society that is constantly stereotyping and casting doubt on our efforts it takes a lot of strength to stand up and doing something that is off the beaten path from where you come from.
