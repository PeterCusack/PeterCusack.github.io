 <h2>How to deal with Conflict</h2>
  <h4>1/25/2015</h4>
<p>
I think that the important thing about conflict is to catch it early. If it builds up over a long period of time it will become something much bigger than the little problem you had at the start. I have a story about this happening. I had a friend group in high school of about ten guys and we all got along great except for me and another kid named will. It wasn't really for any particulate reason, we had just come to be annoyed with each other. At first I thought it was because I just didn't like his personality but then I realized that when he said thing I would get annoyed about if someone else had said them I wouldn't have been annoyed at all. After thinking about it and sitting down with him and talking about it we got down to the root of problem which was a few different things but mostly having to do with your own pride. If I could go back I would have liked to have that sit down talk alot earlier that way we could have skipped a bunch of high school drama. I learned get things figured out at the start rather then tolerating them until they are intolerable.
