  <h2>Version Control with git and Github</h2>
  <h4>11/22/14</h4>
<P>First lets talk about what version control is and why it is useful. Version control is in its simplest the repeated backing-up of your project after you make changes. You can do version control on pretty much anything that you can save, because really it is just saving and storing different stages of your project. It is useful for many reasons, foremost being that if you mess-up your program and save it you can always go back to an earlier version.

  Now version control (VC) can be done in many ways, one of the most popular programs for it and the one we will be talking about is git. Git makes it incredibly easy to do version control on any kind of project. With git all you have to do is initiate tracking of a file through the command line and every time you want to save a version of the project, just enter one command on the command line and BAMB you have a new version that you can always go back to. The other core git feature is collaboration. Git makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same project without interfering with each otherâ€™s code. I could be working on one file of the project and you could be working on another and when we both save them, instead of our saves overriding each other git merges the two documents. Now there can be problems with this, but usually it goes pretty well
 Whenever git is mentioned you hear usually hear github come up as well. Lets be clear on one thing, git is not github. Github is kind of like the Facebook/Dropbox for git. What github does is provide a cloud-based platform where you can store your git files and share them with others. It also allows others to download your code (if its not private) and use it how they want. Also, remember how we talked about collaboration with git earlier. Well github makes collaboration on code project even easier, people can simply download you code make edits and then send a pull request. A pull request is like saying to the owner of the code "hey look at this cool thing I added to your code you should merge my code with yours". This works well for providing some accountability about what gets added to a project.

  This is a very brief overview of git and github and as the title of the blog says I am new to this stuff too so my explantion could be a little off, if so please let me know in the comments!</P>
