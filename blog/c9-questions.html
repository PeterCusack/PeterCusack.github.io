 <h2>How to Ask a Question That Get Answered</h2>
  <h4>2/1/2015</h4>
<p>
  The secret to asking a question that will get answered is putting as much work into it as someone who is answering it will have to. You have to make sure that you are not asking a question that has already been asked, do your research don't ask a question that google can answer. Make it short and well structured, like you are talking to a busy colleague but don't use short code that only programmers will understand. Only copy the code that someone will need to answer the question don't jsut copy in your whole program. In the end you need to ask a question that you would like to answer. Don't just throw a question out there cause you don't want to put the effort in to answer it. That's being what is called a help vampire. Also, don't just post your question and leave it if people ask you to clear something up make an edit to your question, you have ot put the most work in as anyone else trying to answer the question.
