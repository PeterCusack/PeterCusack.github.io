 <h2>Pairing it Caring</h2>
  <h4>4/1/2015</h4>
<p>
Pairing is a bench mark of the Dev bootcamp Experience. Not only does it allow for us as students to become better coders through peer review. It also allows us to get to know our fellow cohort members before the on site work begins. At first peer pairing was really difficult for me to pair with people simply because I felt like it slowed both of us down to have to talk over every point before we did it. But now after having done quite a few paring sessions I've come to really enjoy it. There are still some drawbacks like it taking a little extra time to do anything but you can also learn a lot from your pair, no matter their skill level. In a good pairing session you get to see inside the head of someone else. You learn new tips and tricks and also a lot about work flow and how people approach challenges. I can be frustrating sometime when you are trying to convey an idea and they don't get it or vis versa but it is worth it for the things you learn and the community that is developed.
  Getting feedback is also great. It is very helpful and most the time encouraging. Helpful in that reading through my feedback I definitely found some consistent theme's of things I need to work on. It was also encouraging to here things that you are doing well and that people appreciate pairing with you. It is definitely another way to build a strong community.
