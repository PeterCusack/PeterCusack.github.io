Random Concrete in Dev Bootcamp

My Gregorc Thinking Style is Concrete Random (CR) and I think it's pretty accurate. I definitely learn best by experimenting and trying things out on my own. Because of this I have a hard time with pairing. I enjoy the freedom to work as I wish, and it's hard to get that while working with another person. I know it's something I defiantly need to work on. I've always kind of disliked working in groups in general, even during high school I would usually choose to work alone given the opportunity. But I think that I am getting better, I learning that you do sacrifice some freedom when pairing, but with the sacrifice comes a huge learning opportunity. I really need to learn to capitalize on getting to see how another person thinks.

The growth vs. fixed mindset article was incredible. Very enlightening, I definitely slip into the fixed mindset at times. Especially when I have developed a name for myself somewhere. For example when I take a class that I am good at and the other student know that I am good in that class, I start to focus more on maintaining my status as smart rather than actually trying to learn. So i'll stop asking question about stuff I don't know and things of that nature. I am really excited to go through a program that I all about you pushing yourself and being able to say I don't know or I need help. Most school environments are not like this.
