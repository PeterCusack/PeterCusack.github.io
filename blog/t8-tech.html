 <h2>How does a computer really store memory?</h2>
  <h4>1/25/2015</h4>
<p>
When I first asked myself this question I was a little dumb founded at my lack of understanding. Something that I use everyday and I really have no idea how it works. I this blog post I will talk about how the computer memory of my specific computer works- Flash Memory. Flash Memory (FM) is actually one of the most complicated kinds, ti is solid sate meaning that there are no moving parts so everything is done with electric signals. In short how it works is each bit of data which is a 0 or 1 which all computer memory is based off it represented with a positive or nagitive charge. Now how this charge is changed varies from computer to computer but in a flash memory device it works like this. Through a process called tunneling electrons are passed through a very thin oxide layer. The amount of electrons that pass through is measured by something called a cell sensor. If more than 50% of the electrons pass through it has a value of 1 and if less than 50% then it has a value of 0. This makes for very quick reading of the hard drive and erasing of it. It is also much more expensive then other forms of memory.
