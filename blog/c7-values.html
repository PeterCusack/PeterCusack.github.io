 <h2>Values of Importance</h2>
  <h4>1/18/2015</h4>
<p>
  I would say that the words from this list that most resantaed with me were
  <b/>
Adventure, Challenge, Reputation, Honesty
<b/>
I would say that I rank about a 3 or 4 on trying to live up to these values. They are definitely things that I hope to possess (in the right amount) but I wouldn't say each day I am trying to live up to these values. <b/>
Honesty is probably one of the most important values on this list and the only one I would say I seek everyday. Honesty is the basis for so many things and if you truly live an honest life, then I think many of the other virtues will come along with that. If you are readily admitting anything that you do and be an open life you will be less likely to do things that you would be ashamed to admit. <b/>
I will most often get for advice on things pertaining to adventure. Sometimes when people are about to do something adventurous or risky they will ask me what I think about it, or more often if I would do it myself. I think this is something that we all seek out before taking a risk, the common phrase goes foolishness loves company. I think they consider me to do some pretty crazy stuff, so if I won't do it then it must be too risky. <b/>
Thinking about my values or what I would recognize as my values gives a certain amount of pride. Although these are also subject to a stereo-type threat of types. Naming your values feels awkward, it's hard to tell if these are just the things you  want to posses or the things you actually do.
