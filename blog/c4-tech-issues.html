 <h2>Lack of Divirsity in the Tech World</h2>
  <h4>12/14/14</h4>
<p>
The fact of the matter is that Minority groups unfortunately have never been highly involved in the tech world. At the beginning tech was a very expensive hobby to have, so the oppressed minority groups didn't have the time nor the money to partake. However, that is not to say that minority groups did not have any part in the tech boom, Mark Dean is one of prime examples of African Americans in technology being one of the primary patent holders for IBM original nine patents. However it is true that not nearly as many minorities were involved in the original tech boom and unfortunately the same theme is true today. Many of the largest tech companies have incredibly low diversity, Google recently released its diversity report saying that 61% of their staff are white males, 3% are Hispanic and only 2% black. This is outrageous. I believe it comes from the limited access to computers and programing classes for minority groups. When we are young we are developing are idea's about the world and how we want what we do in the future to impact that world. So you can almost surely say that if technology does not have part in your childhood it will most likely not have a major part in your future.
There are many things that could be done to solve this problem and many of them are being attempted. Many organizations are installing computer centers at inner city schools and holding children seminars on technology. Also, Womens movement toward tech is increasing greatly with many scholarships coming out for women to attend technology schools. But there is still an incredible gap to fill. Kids need to have as easy access to technology as any other form of learning.
